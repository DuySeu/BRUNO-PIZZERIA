                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <p>
                            Welcome to Bruno's Bistrot! We served delicious Italian &
                            French food & even weekend brunch!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bruno started Bruno’s Restaurant over 10 years ago because
                            he sees a lack of authentic Italian food in our Singapore
                            market.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <p>
                            That’s why after his journey to many countries as a Chef
                            learning and exchanging experiences, he came back to our
                            small little sunny island Singapore to settle down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having to love Singapore so much, he became a citizen 20
                            over years ago and has already localized.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And we are just happy that he chose Singapore making us part
                            of his family in this business.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <p>
                            We started our first restaurant at Tanjong Katong in 2010.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A cozy indoor space along the stretch of shop houses giving
                            it a nostalgic touch to the authentic food we serve.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along the way, we had to overcome multiple obstacles and
                            barriers in many aspects. But with the lead of our founder
                            Bruno, we eventually managed to work things out and steadily
                            grow our business.
                        </p>

                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <p>
                            Given that in 2010 we were not as tech savvy as we are now, 
                            the growth is purely based on our quality of food and the support of our customers; 
                            of which many are still giving us their support till this very day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With all those support, we have now 3 outlets in Singapore.
                        </p>

                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <p>
                            We want to be able to maintain our quality of food and
                            support from the customers always, therefore we have been
                            trying out new dishes to bring some fresh experience in our
                            restaurant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oh, have we not mentioned that Bruno is French? Hahaha….
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yes, he is French and therefore we have quite a few French
                            touches in our menu too.
                        </p>

                            customers enjoying our food till their heart’s content.
